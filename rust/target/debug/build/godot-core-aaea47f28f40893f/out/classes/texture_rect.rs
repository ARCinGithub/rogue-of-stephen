It can have child nodes of any type.

When `null` or a non-Control node is returned, the default tooltip will be used instead.\n\nThe returned node will be added as child to a [`PopupPanel`][crate::classes::PopupPanel], so you should only provide the contents of that panel. That [`PopupPanel`][crate::classes::PopupPanel] can be themed using [`set_stylebox`][`crate::classes::Theme::set_stylebox`] for the type `\"TooltipPanel\"` (see \\[member tooltip_text] for an example).\n\n**Note:** The tooltip is shrunk to minimal size. If you want to ensure it's fully visible, you might want to set its \\[member custom_minimum_size] to some non-zero value.\n\n**Note:** The node (and any relevant children) should have their \\[member CanvasItem.visible] set to `true` when returned, otherwise, the viewport that instantiates it will not be able to calculate its minimum size reliably.\n\n**Note:** If overridden, this method is called even if [`get_tooltip`][`crate::classes::Control::get_tooltip`] returns an empty string. When this happens with the default tooltip, it is not displayed. To copy this behavior, return `null` in this method when `for_text` is empty.\n\n**Example:** Use a constructed node as a tooltip:\n\n\n```gdscript\nfunc _make_custom_tooltip(for_text):\n\tvar label = Label.new()\n\tlabel.text = for_text\n\treturn label\n```\n\n\n**Example:** Use a scene instance as a tooltip:\n\n\n```gdscript\nfunc _make_custom_tooltip(for_text):\n\tvar tooltip = preload(\"res://some_tooltip_scene.tscn\").instantiate()\n\ttooltip.get_node(\"Label\").text = for_text\n\treturn tooltip\n```\n"]
